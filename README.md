# BrokenThorn OS Development Series (2025 Edition)

This repository is a modernized walkthrough of the legendary **BrokenThorn OS Development Series** — one of the most influential tutorials for beginner operating system developers.  

The goal of this project is to make the series **more current and runnable in 2025**, while preserving the structure and learning value of the original work. Each tutorial’s code has been carefully adapted, updated, and tested to run on today’s toolchains and environments.
